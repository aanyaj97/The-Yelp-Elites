A friend who lived in Japan says unsalted is the default, but isn't the way I prefer. The crab legs were not great either, but crab legs are not what brought me to this buffet, it was the opportunity to eat an irresponsible amount of sushi and then be able to complain about it on the Internet if they asked me to exercise even a bit of discretion. They did not interrupt my my unrestrained gluttony. I appreciated this at the time, but I wonder how they sleep at night watching gastronomic self destruction shift after shift.\n\nI thought the sushi was pretty good. I went in the afternoon (paying dinner buffet price) on the weekend. The selection was pretty good, and every time I returned, there was more stuff. It really surprised me that they had sashimi, which was well cut. They had a good variety of sashimi, and only one was strong (but I dont remember ... maybe the hamachi?). The rolls were rolled well, too.\n\nAs for freshness, only what I think was the hamachi was maybe off. I am sure it depends on when you go. I tipped the guys working the buffet (as well as my server) because I thought they were good enough to warrant it.\n\nThe service was friendly. I thought it was weird that drinks come in massive beer steins, which do not exactly mesh with the contemporary Asian fusion decor, which is classy and understated.\n\nThere was a group there (I think it was somebody's birthday or engagement or something) and it was clear that this is a good place for a group of people to go.\n\nIf you want to eat a lot of sushi, or want to go to a restaurant with a variety of Asian dishes, plus a lot of sushi that is not expensive, this is a good choice. I wish it wasn't in bumblefuck South Kankakee, and I hope that the location doesn't deep-six the place, but I will be back."}{"review_id": "TfJ2QlHY7sFdPpUyDi27Zg", "business_id": "zswdqM8Av3KxVv9o7_6ORA", "user_id": "c_vQnScwjEmPflK9ntnwmw", "stars": 4.0, "text": "Everything was pretty good but the beef in the Mongolian beef was very chewy and had a weird texture.

I think they could make this into a pretty solid little restaurant if they fix some problems.\nThe drinks are tasty, but very very heavy on the ice. They are charging drink prices comparable to Boltini down the street, which actually gives you a full glass instead of all this padding. We felt a bit ripped off. I also wish that the specialty cocktail selection had some not-sweet cocktails.\nOne of us got a taco plate and the other got a torta plate. On both, the sides left a lot to be desired. I'm pretty sure our beans and rice were out of a can, and the potato wedges were fresh out of the freezer... The tacos themselves (1 shrimp, 1 fish) were pretty good, though! Only complaint is that they didn't double up on the tortillas, so one of mine fell apart a bit. The steak torta was pretty good, although it would have done well with some pickled chiles. \nI am somewhat annoyed that they don't provide free chips with dinner. The entree size isn't that big, which would have been fine if we got chips, but we left feeling hungry.\nAnother rather big oversight is not providing some sort of spicy table salsa. The food wasn't very spicy in itself. Any good Mexican restaurant should have some house salsas.\n\nI think the main problem here is cutting corners in really obvious ways: drinks loaded to brim with ice, no chips, no table salsa, sides are low quality afterthoughts. Even the lack of the doubled up tortilla. Come on guys, tortillas are not expensive. You can afford to give me 4 instead of 2 with my $8 entree.\n\nAnother weird thing that was noted by all my dining companions: Pretty much every Mexican joint in the town has Mexican people working the back AND the front of the house, including several restaurants owned by this very same family. Here, the front of house waitstaff is exclusively white skinny blond ladies. That has to be a conscious decision.  I can't help but throw at least some side eye at an establishment that decided that actual Mexican people aren't \"classy\" enough to wait tables."}{"review_id": "X81JNJJg75edpHgT5nb7xw", "business_id": "yRKrMWQxQaMeR18s5ajcYw", "user_id": "9qAt7wTgl6mYtxPGZGwyWw", "stars": 1.0, "text": "Nothing like paying $10+ for a container of curly fry bits and pieces and a sandwich where the bun is actually more greasy that the bacon that was on it."}{"review_id": "qChAyy6hNJ4UmEk9XCCPAw", "business_id": "SgG5E7PUrCIsEMP0BVSlTg", "user_id": "u7UaLSwFyxVOjD8n6V4ROA", "stars": 4.0, "text": "Modified my previous review after the store owner's thoughtful response to feedback shared. I respect small business owners that put in effort to follow up to feedback shared. After his note, I have gone back to the business and better understand what their focus areas are. \n\nSUMMARY\nCheese & Crackers primarily is an order ahead market. The name 'cheese and crackers' is misleading, as what they offer stretches beyond cheese. You can order a range of things like artisanal cheese trays, cured meats to seafood. The trick is to visit their website and sign up for their mailing list. There, you'll get a better feel for the range of products Cheese & Crackers offers on a weekly basis beyond what you just see in-store. \n\nPROS:\n- Order Seafood: They have a mailing list to order fresh seafood. Sign up on their website. They bring in fresh, high quality seafood from Canada. I went to a dinner party that served fresh salmon from here - was delightful. \n- Catering: They are a great fit for catering, in particular artisanal cheese platters and trays. \n- Baguette Sandwiches To Go: They serve sandwiches on baguettes like thinly sliced roast beef.\n- Cheese Assortment: They have an extensive list of featured cheeses.\n\nCONS: \n- They don't offer in-store or to-go cheese plates - only order ahead. I would love to be able to stop by, select 3-4 cheeses, take them home to try that evening. \n- They have a few bistro tables, but the store footprint is small thus it isn't really a spot to hang out in-store. \n- The sandwiches are only served on baguettes, and the baguettes are really tough on your teeth / hard to bite. Would be nice to offer another bread option for sandwiches, as the sandwiches are very tasty."}{"review_id": "prYlHMl9ZbatlotBAuub8w", "business_id": "FUr2uEolARu7rv2TQYKPqg", "user_id": "8c53BdBWPcbioN3WZJWdCA", "stars": 3.0, "text": "the location is the only real reason i eat here.  it's the first food option when walking from the Engineering campus to Green Street.  the food is not bad but not spectacular either.  you can basically get anything you want in terms of pasta, pizza, or salad.  the cheesecake factory offerings always look good and i'm happy they are there, but i've never actually eated any of that so can't comment on the quality.  lots of seating makes it less stressful if you are hoping to discuss something important with your lunch companions."}{"review_id": "V5rnrCTg13Ose-6R2y_0pg", "business_id": "2KyPvxkqIdJsLUjAsZBBhw", "user_id": "PejKZGK3E27-4L2k0smVoA", "stars": 5.0, "text": "Location.

I find it pleasant, and generally pretty quiet. When I went in late August, there were ample tables, black chairs and gray carpet. Overall, it was a bit drab and dim for a Thai place. They also seem to have a mini stage which makes me wonder if this place offers, or its prior owners, offered karaoke. The lighting was a little dim for my taste too, but it is okay.

This time, it was fabulous.  The cakes were moist, tender, and really tasty.  Prices still high, but this time it seemed worth it.  They have lowered the prices for a dozen cupcakes and dropped the box charge.  They also took cereal off the menu.\n\nMinus 1 star because of the prices and because the gelato that comes with the $6 pairing wasn't that great.  The serving was also really small.  I'll skip the gelato and stick with a cupcake and a nice glass of milk when I go back.  I'd also prefer a sweeter, less greasy frosting, but that's a personal taste thing and It's probably not fair to fault them for my personal preference.\n\nOverall, I was very impressed with the changes.  It made for a really nice evening to sit at the outdoor bar and enjoy a great cupcake on a warm spring evening, and I look forward to doing so again soon.\n\n*******\nI REALLY wanted to love this place.  I went in a few days after they opened and was disappointed to see that they are very overpriced.  But I didn't let that get me down.  I figured the prices must be reflective of the quality, and I got ready to sample what I expected would be some phenomenal cupcakes.  \n\nTo my dismay, these expensive cupcakes are really not that good.  The few I brought home for everyone to sample were extremely dry and bland.  The texture reminded me of the free hunk of cake you get for your birthday at cheesy chain restaurants.\n\nI'd had very high hopes for the salted caramel, but there was no hint of salt and the caramel element tasted like sugar that had been burnt, not caramelized.  The Red Velvet had a hint of cream cheese flavor in the frosting, but wasn't very sweet and had no chocolate flavor.  The high point was the strawberry balsamic, which was a nice combination of flavors but, like the others, very poorly executed.  It was really just a plain, dry, flavorless cupcake with some pretty decent strawberry frosting (which I actually liked very much) and a drizzle of thick vinegar.  Overall though, I'm sorry to report that  I've had better cupcakes from a box.\n\nSpeaking of boxes, if you want one to carry your cupcakes home in, It'll cost you $1.  With as much as they're charging for the cupcakes, you'd think they'd give you something to carry them home in.  Nope.  That's extra.  Insult to injury, if you will.\n\nI'm inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt and try it again in a few months to give them a chance to get into the swing of things and, with any luck, turn out a better cupcake.  My hope is that the strawberry balsamic frosting is an indicator of a potential that they will reach once they get past the first few weeks.  Unfortunately, I don't know that they'll be around in a few months and I'm also not sure that I'd be willing to pay their insane prices even if the cupcakes were to improve substantially."}{"review_id": "r5FgQuuFX4SypntLS-Qidw", "business_id": "uGwwPkw2AEvKkVHiSufhzQ", "user_id": "eaCznBMQy9fgl4Fe0jBtUw", "stars": 5.0, "text": "This place impressed me a lot.

Crushed, canned pineapple on the (moldy) guacamole; mushy, gross rice with obviously pre-frozen vegetable medley folded into it; lukewarm coffee.  I didn't even get asked how I wanted my eggs on my huevos rancheros, and they came out over-hard (blech).  The tortillas (like the chips) were stale.  \n\nThe service was terrible as well, complementing their awful food.  Our waitress only brought one of us a water (odd choice), asked for our drink order and walked away after only ONE of us answered, tripped and sloshed my lukewarm coffee all over the mug and saucer, and rather than cleaning it up, simply set it down, asked if I wanted a napkin, and never returned with one -- leaving me with a mug covered in coffee.  We had to ask for silverware after our food was delivered.

Five minutes later, \"someone\" came by and seated us, not at one of the several available spacious booths, but at a small card table near the kitchen. We had to ask for water, which didn't come until much later. When our soup came, we had to ask for crackers-one package to split between the two of us is all we received. I decided to go all out and ask for my very own package of crackers and one package containing two saltines is exactly what I received. Generally, in an Italian restaurant, garlic bread with olive oil and Parmesan are brought with your appetizer. Nope. Supposedly, you had a choice of either garlic or regular bread with each meal, but when our meals came-no bread. We finally asked for and were given exactly one slice of bread each. Ok, let's talk about the meal. I had been going to this place for decades, and I have always ordered the same thing-half ravioli, half spaghettini. I started to inquire about this, and this random woman cleaning a table behind us chimed in quite loudly and aggressively \"we can't do that! That just isn't possible!\" Um, why would that be, exactly? It was \"possible\" the many other times I've been there, and, as both items are still on the menu, one puzzles over why this would suddenly not be \"possible\". Most business establishments realize that making their customers happy is not only good business, but a nice thing to do. But, ok, message loudly and clearly received. I picked the spaghettini and added meatballs. We placed bets on how many meatballs close to $5 extra would buy you at Manzella's. I bet 2, and I guess you could say I won if 2 meatballs for nearly $5 is winning-not sure I do, actually. Of our meals, mine was the most edible, and it tasted like a $20 bowl of Chef Boyardee spaghetteos. We all drank water, which we did have to ASK for and wasn't brought until our meal. I guess that's a good thing, and I wish we had drank it more slowly because that one glass was all any of us ever got. My pregnant daughter-in-law was trying desperately to get extra drops out of the glasses she was so thirsty, and my son gave up trying to get a refill. They were t exactly busy but, ok, whatever. By this point, we pretty much knew what the answer was going to be to this next question, but what the heck-we were there specifically because my son's birthday was a few days ago, and my daughter-in-law's is a few days away-this was turning out to be quite the birthday celebration! BIG shocker here-No, Manzella's could give a hot damn that you chose their establishment to celebrate your birthday in-no free cake (or even an extra package of saltines or a refill of that water you had to ask for!) So then the bill comes. My daughter-in-law had asked for Alfredo sauce to be substituted on her pasta dish. By this point, I'm fully expecting a pretty healthy up charge for that, although we weren't advised of it ahead of time. I mean, this entire thing, from walking in the door to paying the bill and never coming back had been so relentlessly mediocre at best, I really didn't think they could surprise me anymore. Then, I looked at the bill. And yes, there was an up charge of about $3.75 to switch the sauce-AND another $15.00 for a dish we didn't order, written right underneath the dish she DID order-with the up charge listed below it, then, apparently, the dish that would normally have come with the sauce she asked for, we were charged for too, but of course never asked for or received! If the good had been great, or the service out of this world (in a good way), maybe that would have mitigated some of the overall unpleasantness of this entire experience. Not a single one of us had a good meal, and we truly aren't picky or high maintenance. I've been a waitress, my sister is a waitress, I still work in customer service and know what people can put you through. We aren't complainers, we don't send food back if it's not perfect. My daughter-in-law's salad dressing was full of watery substance, my sauce was runny, and my son's ravioli was half cold, and we never sent anything back or asked for better, we just tried to eat as best we could and get out of there, agreeing that we'd never go back nor would we recommend it to anyone we didn't hate. This used to be a pretty good place to get a delicious meal at a decent price from friendly and attentive staff. Sadly, none of that is true now. By 8 pm, as I sat here trying to write this, the parking lot was completely empty on a Saturday night, so I don't really think my review is really much of a surprise to anyone."}{"review_id": "rVyQu1XbW2qcY2JGTSW5Yg", "business_id": "44pzzXXYBtbC0QxHFosagw", "user_id": "Wv2jLsNNQmt8gHvU9Ku-PA", "stars": 5.0, "text": "If you want great eyebrows I whole-heartedly recommend this place.

The place does have a spartan look right now, but as with everything else I give them the benefit of the doubt and expect they'll make changes or not make it. They've barely been open a week!\n\nAs for the price, given that this is what they make and virtually all they sell, I think to come in, sit at the counter, eat a cupcake with a glass of water and chat for 15 minutes with a server, $3.25 is hardly enough for them to stay in business. Cupcake vs. latte at $3.25? Cupcake wins.

I'm a long-time Marriott customer, but sadly, this is a hotel that I'll be avoiding in the future. Before the specifics of my most recent experience with these folks, I'd have to say that the main problem with this hotel seems to be that its management simply lacks the commitment to Marriott's usual high-standard for quality and service. The current manager, Steven Steinhauer, personifies ineptness/incompetence, and he conveys a curious lack of interest/concern in the quality of service provided by the hotel. Now to the specifics of my 3-day stay last week... I'm a Marriott Rewards member... always, I'm given some kind of welcome token... nothing too exciting -- bottle of water, cookie, apple, whatever... always, though, there' s some kind of coupon for the bistro. Zippo on all counts... Then to the room... on the ground floor... strange smell in the room -- not quite \"moldy\", but not nice smelling either... OK, I'm busy and need to head out for a meeting so I just \"deal with it\" for now... Get up early the next morning, and I leave some toiletries with the free shampoo/conditioner... I come back late in the evening and find that my toiletries have been \"thrown away\" (I'm assuming they weren't actually stolen by the cleaning staff -- goodness, who would steal toiletries?!). At this point, I am now losing patience with my Marriott \"experience\". All of this was conveyed to the hotel's management -- not once, but TWICE. They could have cared less. How disappointing... Inept management is to blame -- Marriott's otherwise good reputation besmirched by an incompetent fool who will, no dout, be fired soon enough."}{"review_id": "GlakQkTjeEFku9kDDOHbHw", "business_id": "pjO0ZRGpCwlaOzipZDa3HA", "user_id": "6Onq9p166Op7mD_1oyL4qg", "stars": 1.0, "text": "I came into this location with a flat tire for repairs in the tire and auto center this afternoon.

I was hungry and against my better judgement decided to go to this AYCE buffet for dinner. It was a weeknight so luckily there was no line. At first glance I was super excited by the variety of food offered here and 10.99 this is a lot cheaper than the sushi/asian seafood buffets up north. This is where Chinatown buffet took a sharp u-turn from other restaurants that at least feign cleanliness. I watched as they were preparing food from a white bucket on the floor by the grill. I have no idea what sort of food was being prepared, but it should neither be stored in a white unmarked bucket, in a unrefrigerated area, or anywhere near the floor. Let me tell you about the food I ate:\n1. Sushi- yes they had salmon nigri. I was excited that there was 4 fresh pieces of it when I arrived and 4 other pieces of an unknown fish. I took the 2 pieces of salmon, not fatty at all very thin cut. Not cold either... I didn't think much until the end of the meal when I went back outside and the same 6 pieces were left. I guess other people were smarter than me. I also had a few pieces of the rolls. The fried roll was somehow ice cold and the one that had some sort of seafood rolled was warm. This is bad news\n2. Chinese food crab rangoon okay nothing exciting with this, chicken okay nothing exciting\n3. Crab legs- these should be exciting and super expensive, but for some weird reason they are dark colored and very dirty. Even the water that they were boiled in looked like no one washed the crab legs and the dirt or sediment was cooked with it. The meat was slightly firm, but not mushy which you would except with dead crabs\n4. Clams- stir fried in black bean sauce. Okay but you always worry what quality is being served as they are a filter organism that can harbor hepatitis A, bacterial, etc.\n5. Grilled \"ribeye\"- how would you like it done.. medium rare.. 5 minutes later I get a minute steak that when I cut into it, the meat is well well done. I eat it and go back for more because I like meat. Again same thing. It looks nothing like the steak in the pictures and I question whether this is really ribeye\n6. More asian food egg rolls, salmon, green beans, and ribs. Most of this was over cooked and very greasy. Just check out the shininess in the pictures I took\n7. Crawfish- another seafood item that looked good but not clean with dark dirt material. Ugh\n9. Corn, fried chicken, chinese donut. Well you can't mess up these basic items so no complaints.\n10. Dessert- The only POSITIVE thing was the red bean fried sesame balls. I ate 6 these were tasty. The brownie looked disgusting with the sprinkles losing color into the brownie. The peanut brittle was burnt and not edible. The soft serve ice cream is served without cones. It did not appear to melt as it sat on the table and the \"hot fudge\" that was used basically deflected off the ice cream. I have no idea what was in the fudge but it tasted very artificial. \nThere is a lot of other things I did not try including make your own stir fry, soups, etc. If you want quantity this is the place to go. Quality is way below acceptable levels both in quality or hygiene in my opinion. \n\nFINALLY to make matters worse, at 3 AM I had rip roaring abdominal pain. No other symptoms so I don't know if something was not prepared well or just too greasy. I am glad this experience is over.\n\nPro: Run away\n\nCons: Poor hygiene, seafood that did not look clean, below average quality, you can get food poisoning especially based on there preparation of food\n\nHidden gem:\nGo to centralillinoissavings.com and print out coupons for lunch and dinner if you dare come here\nLunch Buffet 6.99\nDinner Buffet 10.99\nWeekend Buffet 11.99\nSunday Buffet 10.99\nSoda 1.99"}{"review_id": "3jFke9xi6k4w-AF1Kicw8g", "business_id": "CrIWqmuO2uQWwl3z11K_BA", "user_id": "3LXIUdXs8jR9dPzG01sMnA", "stars": 5.0, "text": "Fine artisan pizza right here in Champaign.

My wife recently directed me and my son to go see the laser kid show. It is not too hard to find if you follow along with the signs, however the parking for the planetarium is off to the side and again there is a super amount of construction making it difficult to get to the main doors. We came for the Saturday laser show which I guess they occasionally rent the laser machine to put on these shows. The time for the show was reported to be 1 hour, but it was more like 20-25 minute. They went through explaining what can be seen in the stars tonight and then off to the main attraction. The story given was of Perseus and his battles with medusa and co. My four year old enjoyed the show. Total cost for 1 adult and 1 child was 11 dollars. Looking at the website shows there are events all the time here including Artemis Bridge Simulator if you and your techie friends are interested.... Overall if you are into science this is a great place to visit, but for me one visit is enough. \n\nPros: great place for kids, laser shows, astronomy, video games and more. This is a great place for the science lover\n\nCons: Construction all around difficult to get to from parking. \n\nHidden deals: Occasionally science talks for 1 dollar."}{"review_id": "JiPaQDHMMcd8R9YAd8IoTA", "business_id": "5lw5rrhFMz-liykUn8dGSw", "user_id": "RNUMIFsVG0rZnebnTOErpw", "stars": 5.0, "text": "The best pork tacos I have ever had!

The last several experiences we have gotten have been less than satisfactory. My best friend chose Seno's for her wedding last October. Payment plans were nice. She got her invites free as well. \n\nThe day all the groomsmen and groom are supposed to pick up their tuxedos we come across a ton of issues. Shirts were too short or too long depending on the groomsmen. Some shirts were the wrong size entirely. They messed up my fiance's shoe size twice! We called to make sure they had his size since his is a size 17-18. They assured us they had it but by the time he picked them up (granted he probably should have checked before leaving the shop), went back home to start getting ready since we were now 3 hours away from the ceremony, he realized they were the wrong size again. He called me at my hair appointment and by then I told him there was no way to have them fix it and get to the venue on time. He had to use his own shoe which didn't match.\n\nDespite this issue we tried again when price checking for our own wedding this coming March. They didn't have suits in the colors I needed but they had tuxedos in similar colors, again not exact colors - my bridesmaids all got their dresses from David's Bridal. My fiance's sister is standing with him so her dress is in a light grey color. I of course wanted matching suits or tuxes to she wasn't standing out. We were quoted a price and checked around.\n\nMen's Wearhouse - which is the brother shop to David's Bridal - had the exact colors we needed and in suits which my fiance was very clear he wanted. We got a great deal too. We went back to Seno's to see if they could do better on the tuxes since the color didn't match. They spoke with their general manager and was only able to beat Men's Wearhouse by $5-$10 (prices varied if the groomsmen brought their own shoes or not). They said they couldn't go any further down.\n\nWe ultimately went with Men's Wearhouse since they were giving us exactly what we wanted and it was only going to cost us $5-$10 more per suit."}{"review_id": "0RUJAb_6yRqh6iMwor-wMQ", "business_id": "9lnuKe2KsTsg-tb8Kuxyvw", "user_id": "eHK5sl_EbS7GFD1ABJLX8w", "stars": 1.0, "text": "I was in town for a reunion and remembered the Lincoln Lodge as a one-of-a-kind place with charming features and a homey ambiance.

In this one, a dry, dirty mop was propped up against the wooden bar, where, presumably, guests would sit, and the lobby in general was musty and worn; faded and dusty. The general sense was of neglect... like no one's loved or taken care of this place in a very long time! \n\nThe man who checked me in was pleasant, however, accommodating my early arrival, which I appreciated, but that was pretty much the only good point of my stay.\n\nPhotos of this place on various websites are deceptive. Yes, exposed brick walls and warm wood accents usually DO lend charm to a room, but these rooms have long ago lost their luster: Dusty, dirty, with ugly furniture that looked like someone raided a dump, and towels & bedspreads so thin and flimsy they suggested toss-offs from a dorm. With window shades broken, a dirty carpet, and a dubious clean quotient overall, the impression was seedy and cheap. \n\nAnd though this was a non-smoking room, the odor that wafted out when you opened the door was overpowering -- I don't know if it was smoke or just \"old room\" smell, but whatever it was, it was definitely not good! \n\nGood points: the bed was comfortable, Wifi was free, and the staff was nice.

Jet's was a possibility, but they don't have indoor seating and we'd be relegated to eating pizza in the van.   So this is what came up on Yelp.   This pizza place is smack in between Seaboat and Jarlings.  So I knew if the pizza was a complete disaster, we'd at least have a good ice cream dessert afterwards!   Vinny's has a small/medium sized dining area.   They have a HUGE menu -- tons of pizza options (make your own, hawaiian, gyro, cheeseburger, mexican, BBQ chicken, and any other combination you can think of).  They have calzones, salads, appetizers, wings, slices (they roll out new slices every two hours and each day they pick about 10 different varieties to make).  The prices are reasonable.... we ordered a large supreme pizza (pepperoni, mushroom, sausage, peppers, onions), along with a bottle of rootbeer and an apple juice -- came to $22.   The pizza came out within about 10 minutes.   My toddler son was happy.   For NY style, it definitely wouldn't fly in NYC.  Not a chance.  But here, in Champaign.... it's not bad.   There's no char on the bottom of the pizza.... the crust is thin, chewy, crunchy and foldable.  The bottom is covered in cornmeal if I'm not mistaken....  The toppings were ok -- generous.

Chipotle #3. Not exactly trendy, but the food is better at those places. \n\nWas this worth a \"date night\" with my husband ? Not really. When you have to pay for a baby-sitter a date night better be worth it! Wedge was more miss than hit for us, and while it wasn't terrible, it just isn't worth a repeat for us, especially since we can't really come here with our son - too bar-like b/c most of the tables have high bar stools. There are better (casual and pricy) places for a date in C-U. \n\nPros:\nThe server was great! Mixed up a fancy N/A juice for me since I'm pregnant. \n\nThe fish tacos- very good- loved the sauce especially. But go easy on the cabbage!\nThe steak tacos w/ poblano - good.\n\nBeer prices were reasonable.\n\nMeh: \nTacos al Pastor - decent, but not worth a repeat visit, IMO. \nGuacamole - decent flavor- a bit too acidic, not enough salt.\n\nCons: \nChips and salsa are NOT free - it's $3 for an order!\n\nBeans - fresh out of a.... Can. So easy to make good beans, no excuses here.\n\nGuacamole price was high compared to other places around town (and yes, I know the cost of an avocado $0.90-1.79/each- esp owning the El Toros in town, I'm sure the owners get them cheaper than we can at Meijer. Price was $6 for a small portion that was *maybe*a single avocado. \n\nSeated right by the door - kept getting interrupted so servers could get liquor out, new patrons walking in - it was freezing! Forget a  nice date - we were cold and felt *very* rushed. If you want to get drinks and linger, or dessert, sit in the back. If you want a Jimmy Johns \"Freaky Fast\" experience, sit in the front. \n\nCarnitas taco - absolutely disgusting. It tasted like the meat was rotten. The nuts were whole and just didn't work  - would be better chopped up, but they dont' really add to the taco. This actually made me feel sick.

It was a grey cloudy day and it had just finished raining, as cute as it looked, outside seating was out of the question.

Finally decided to have the steak torta, carnitas taco, chips and ranchero guacamole. \n\nThere was no stagnant wait time to place my order as the bartender was very attentive despite the semi crowded bar. It was about give minutes later, boom, my chips come out. The chips are a crunchy kind of good. There are three kinds of guacamole in which I ordered the chunky spicy kind. It was a perfect accompaniment with my drink and anticipation for my meal. \n\nBefore I can get halfway down my drink and just as I got over the chips, tada... Here comes my food. The timing couldn't be any more spot on. \n\nThe steak torta was very tasty. It was seasoned and moist with the toasted bread just crisp. The sandwich was pretty darn good. On the plate were also potato wedges that came with aioli dip. Without the dip, the wedges were.. meh. It's all about that dip. \n\nDone with my first drink, I gave the bar tender a nod and boom another one came. Completed my steak, on to my taco. The carnitas or pork, was a bit dry and it was just ok. Following the steak, it wasn't great. Finished it anyway, dipped it in the guac and poured salsa on it. That did the trick. \n\nMunched on the chips some more as I wrote this review. \n\nThe environment is clean, friendly and inviting. The wait staff is awesome. The food is great.

On the day of pick up - the computer system was \"down\". The employees inside ultimately told us they were not able to assign a one-way trailer without access and that they were unable to help me. No other locations nearby were open or had available trailers in any size. As advised, I contacted the general manager, Andre Hubbard, who was out of the area. \n\nMr. Hubbard was rude, inconsiderate, and unhelpful. He made no effort to reach a resolution. During our call - he never asked for my name, the details of my reservation, or the reservation number I had available. He made degrading and insulting remarks in my ability to understand the situation. Even after I asked specifically, he did not offer to contact anyone else in the regional area for assistance.\n\nWith no help or direction from Andre, I contacted the number written on the vehicle in the parking lot: 1 800 - go - Uhaul. A woman in transportation, Tammy, was immediately able to assist me and provide me a trailer assignment. \n\nI spent more than 3 hours waiting and delayed during my rental pick up due to the poor management and operations of this establishment. Many other customers were affected on this same day. If it was not for my own perseverance, I would have not received a trailer or continued with my plans to move. \n\nThe employees at the establishment were eager and willing to help.

She would not let my friend order a virgin drink, because \"sweetheart it tastes bad.\" My friend even said I do it all the time ( and we have done it before at wedge), and she still just shook her head no.

I practically have to chase her down to tell her that no one ordered soup and I ordered nachos. She snatches away the tacos and soup and tells me \"sweetheart it will be a few minutes.\" I tell my friends to start eating, and 15 minutes later she comes back with ice cold nachos.

They took the time to remember my name and the scheduling was very easy.  They also took a very thorough look at my teeth and gums- everything from an oral cancer screening to measuring the softness of my teeth and gums in order to check for cavities.  They also didn't give me a hard time about not having a check up/cleaning for 5 years.\n\nHowever, they told me that I had 7 cavities and needed a very expensive gum treatment.  I know I hadn't been in for awhile, but that seemed a little over the top to me.  Thankfully I have dental insurance, but even with my insurance the cost of all of that was going to be pretty outrageous.  I got a second opinion from another dentist before spending all that money, and learned that none of it was necessary.  I feel like they look for problems that aren't there in order to make extra money.\n\nLike I said, my experience wasn't entirely negative but I would suggest being wary of any excessive or expensive procedures."}{"review_id": "eBO6Vnk2Qm9O2cdAM71Qsw", "business_id": "DrTZoBYke80zH1herrG0_g", "user_id": "9_YQcRQtk3O-HSGuJNYlog", "stars": 1.0, "text": "Elite provided awful service for our friends daughters wedding in our opinion .

Me and my roommates can't shower at the same time or else the hot water will run out.  Also they didn't want to pay for parking spaces mandated by the city (1 per every 2.5 beds in a building) so they copped out by making the three bedroom rentals 2 bedrooms with an optional third loft space (so the building technically has less beds).  Lastly because it was a liability (aka insurance costs more than they wanted to pay) there are no heavy weights in the rec/exercize room.  Also the pool table, air hockey table, and dart boards were clearly bought at walmart and are very cheap.  The pool table is undersize and balls get stuck in it every time, all the darts are broken for the dart board, and the air hockey table just sucks."}{"review_id": "2QpEnQiR14RpsDWeZY4zUw", "business_id": "2KyPvxkqIdJsLUjAsZBBhw", "user_id": "NS3B17yHv2lBJfGuwSmVNw", "stars": 5.0, "text": "We have stayed here several times and for an extended period of time.

If you want pizza in a sit-down restaurant, this is definitely a great place to go.   Heck, I think it's probably one of the best restaurants in the whole downtown Champaign area.   Everything on the menu is authentic.... they use 00 Caputo flour which is the best kind to use for pizza.   Everything is as if you'd find it in Italy --- the gelato is shipped in from Italy (via Chicago twice a week)... the olive oils they use are shipped in and even the tomatoes are San Marzano's!!!  The owner is super friendly and is great with the kids.   Rather than the traditional crayons and coloring pages, he gives them little balls of dough to occupy them while the pizzas are cooked (and they've greatly improved on this area --- we had our pizzas within 8 minutes of ordering!!!).   Once the kids were done creating -- he cooked them!!!!!  That was the icing on the cake.... my kids' faces lit up when he brought them their handmade dough creations!!    Even after inhaling their pizza (my 5yr old ate 4 slices in a matter of minutes), he was eating his bread!!!  And my 3yr old even inhaled 2 slices and still ate her bread!!!  Awesome.   As for us, my hubby and I ordered an Italian salad which was so flavorful --- the lettuce was great, the peppers were great and so were the tomatoes!!!  The dressing only enhanced everything else!! YES!    We also ordered the Cantalupo (?) --- it was tomato sauce, mozzarella, hot italian sausage and spicy olive oil --- it was fantastic!!! The crust and toppings came together beautifully!!!   And they even opened up a gelato bar --- which was heaven in frozen-form.   My son got the raspberry gelato which was so bright and fresh!  The chocolate gelato was my favorite by far!!!  My husband loved his salted caramel --- I thought that was too rich, but my husband said that there is no such thing as too much caramel.   \n\nAnd for those who are complaining that they don't do carry-out.....you need to eat this type of pizza right out of the oven for optimal taste amd quality.   Eat a few slices here and take the rest home - you'll agree it won't taste the same as it did right out of the oven.  If you want pizza in a box, there's Papa John's or Little Caesars.....if you want great pizza in a box, find Dragon Fire.   So there you have it folks --- amazing, authentic pizza in a sit-down restaurant....in Champaign!?!!  Who would've thought??\n\nWe spoke with the owner as we were about to leave and he told us that he's competing in Las Vegas at the World Pizza Championships (!!!!)  with their signature pizza (the Pistachio -- I'll have to try that next time!!)  -- going up against Mario Batali and all the NYC pizzerias and other top places from around the country.....

(If you do so they still charge you carpet clean fee) Therefore, you will have few hundred more bill when moving out compare to other companies. MAKE SURE YOU TAKE PHOTO OF EVERYTHING WHEN YOU MOVE IN&OUT!!! COPY THE CONDITION LIST SHEET before you turn it in.\nLaundry: Laundry machine ate my coins often.\nDishonesty: Their mouths were full of lies toward international students, and I am not the only victim of their lie. It's quite often that they lie about condition of apts when they *talk* about the room. So you must VISIT THE EXACT ROOM THAT YOU WILL LIVE IN BEFORE YOU SIGN THE LEASE.  Misleading information include package/parking. (e.g. they fool international students by UPS/USPS, where pretend Amazon's package though UPS able to enter building. / Pretend the rent include parking, but documented in contract for +$25 or more.) Take your time read the lease documents! Again, you must visit the exact room!\nPS: all these cons were true for old apts, if you live in their new building (e.g. Skyline Tower), then the only problem is Overprice.\nIn summary: Live in their old build will give you an average to below average experience. (3 to 2 star) Their new building should give you a good to excellent experience. (4 to 5 star).\n\nOthers: C-U area generally tend to be very safe (compare to Chicago downtown, & etc...), and this area does not have bed bug problem too. Most of apts does not have cockroach (or the pest control work really well).

My brothers wanted to go to lunch here, so I figured I'd ask if they had a discount for Veterans. I was very happily surprised. They provided me a sandwich/entree of my choice, 1 side, a large drink, and most unexpectedly, a dessert. 100% gratis. \nI got the chicken salad on croissant, and it was better than I thought it would be: cranberries and pecan chunks, the right ratio of sweet to savory, and the croissant was fresh. My side was cole slaw which was decent. They gave me a small bucket to put my drink in (ok, 32 oz). Their sweet tea is indeed all that. If you're from North of the M-D line, or if you just don't like your tea tooth-achingly sweet, do what I did and mix sweet & unsweet. Excellent. \nWhen the cashier said dessert I was thinking chocolate chip cookie, a-la Jimmy John's (which would NOT have been a bad thing - I love those cookies). But what I got was so much better -- NY style cheesecake. I must say, besides the kind service and the Veteran love, this is why I'm writing this review.

I LOVE dosas.   And maybe just the fact that they have dosas made me delusional.   \n\nI came here earlier in the week and ordered the spicy masala dosa.   It came out in all it's golden brown crepe-like goodness, served with mint (?) chutney and lentil soup.   I tore into it and boy was it good.  I was eating bits of the crepe and dipping it in both the chutney and the soup.   It had a bit of a kick to it!  Then I realized that I wasn't getting any \"masala\" part.  I opened it and there was maybe two tablespoons worth of filling.  Red flags should've been going up, but I just kept eating and dipping.  I was satisfied. I figured that since there was so little filling, I was keeping my calorie count down for the day! Bonus for me!!!  It cost about $9 for the dosa. \n\nI returned two nights later to pick up some takeout for dinner.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala with rice AND naan.   During the day, they have a hot bar/buffet going on which runs from 11 - 2:30.  (When I went in earlier in the week -- I came in at noon and the buffet STILL wasn't ready -- by the time I left at 12:30 -- it still wasn't there so who knows when it starts) I came in around 4pm.... the hot bar/buffet hadn't been cleaned up and there were bins with the dredges (hardened and dried and OLD food that are left at the bottom).   I kind of look grossed out by what was left and the man (cook? waiter?) assured me there was food in the back.  After I ordered, he went into the kitchen and came back out with a plastic container of rice (which looked as if it was microwaved -- there were bubbles of moisture on the inside of the plastic... if it was fresh, there would've just been cloudy steam.... these were water droplets already!!) and some naan wrapped in foil.   Then he took a takeout box and went to the hot bar and stirred up one of the containers (it was red and there was an oily lake of grease lying on top of it) and started to spoon it into a container.   I was in shock that I couldn't speak.   He remembered that I also ordered a mango lassi --- he went over to the sliding door fridge and pulled out a pre-made lassi that for all I knew, had been made yesterday!   Anyway, it was $10 and all I could think was, \"This can't be good, this can't be good.\" Picked up my son from school, went home and we sat down at the table.   I unwrapped the naan and there was a huge hole in the middle (it wasn't a rip... it was a HOLE as if somebody had eaten it from the middle!! Plus it was hard as a rock) and as I put the first bite of tikka masala in my mouth, I pulled out stems from some unknown herb..... needless to say, I couldn't/didn't even want to feed it to my son.   I wound up throwing everything down the garbage disposal and warmed up last night's leftovers of rice, shake&bake chicken and heated up some corn.

We have been to other similar venues across the country and were excited to try the Art Party Studio in Champaign last night because we enjoyed the others so much.  Sadly, we were disappointed.\n\nLet's start with the positives:\n\n- Unlike other venues, in Champaign it is a BYOE (Everything - drinks and food) which wasn't a problem for us, since it gave us the flexibility of bringing what we wanted to drink.  Everything else was fairly similar. \n\n- The studio were set up fairly nicely, aprons were provided, and the artist's canvas was shown live on a big screen TV above the stage so that everyone could see what she was doing, which was a very nice touch that we had not seen before. \n\n- The studio was well lit, and had a very nice atmosphere. \n\n- each person attending the event had an easel set up with a canvas that had a pattern drawn on it, paints prepared on a paper plate, and water and brushes. It was nice not to have to get all of that for ourselves before the class started, as there would have been a traffic jam with all of the people around the paint area.\n\n- We were greeted when we walked in by a very nice gentleman who ensured that we were set up and understood what would be happening.\n\nThen the fun began. Or, rather, it was supposed to. Here are the disappointing parts:\n\n- when the painting was about to begin, the instructor got onstage, and just jumped right in. There was no banter, chitchat, introduction, or discussion on what would be happening that night. Just straight to business. It felt awkward and uncomfortable, and didn't start the night out on a positive note.\n\n- The instructor demonstrated what we would be doing, but neglected to tell us key points about what techniques to use or what to avoid until it was too late. This happened multiple times through the night, almost at every step of the way. It is very frustrating to find out what not to do after you've already done it, and now you've been told how it will mess up your painting.\n\n- when I ran out of blue paint I asked for more (the paint jars were not set up to be a help yourself - no labels or anything) and was given a stern look by the instructor after she checked my plate to ensure I really did need more. I was given a little more, and was told that if I needed more I needed to water it down so that the paint would go farther. Later, when I asked for a second paper plate to mix colors, I was told I didn't need another, and that I could mix the colors over the colors I had on my first plate. Seriously? We paid $60 to be given a canvas, some paint, some instruction, but most of all a fun night. Being lectured about paint usage and an extra paper plate really dampened the vibe. Are we in elementary school again?\n\n- We were never checked on, or asked if we needed any help or were doing okay. This was unusual compared to other studios. Questions to the instructor were answered, but after a few unenthusiastic answers people just stopped asking questions. The only time the instructor circulated through the room was when she had her camera out to take what she called her PR photos. Frustration and photos do not mix well.\n\n- overall we felt like our creativity was stifled - we were constantly reminded of the \"right\" way the painting should look as opposed to being encouraged to put our own mark on our pieces, down to using the right colors in the right places and the requirement of painting the sides of the canvas. \n\nWe left the event with two very similar looking pieces, as did everyone else. The night felt rushed, especially after the event when the instructor told us to clean up and then immediately began putting materials away. This vibe ensured that no one stayed to chat or enjoy the night. \n\nIt would have been a great and needed  addition to Champaign / Urbana entertainment, but was really not fun enough for repeated visits.

My girlfriend was willing to risk having her pizza in the ashes of wheat flour (she wasn't fooled by the waiter saying gluten burns up in the oven). Our bigger problem was the chef rolling out a wheat crust on the counter then using his same bare hands to top her gf crust. And the fact that it was impossible to retrieve her pizza from the oven using the \"pan\" it came on, the chef had to paddle it out with the usual instrument.\n\nIt's fine if they can't service celiac customers, we get that.

I was a little put off by the added cost of the toppings. The sausage cost $2.50 and the green pepper also cost $2.50. If I were to add only a couple more toppings, the cost of our pizza would have been $10 in toppings alone, which seems odd. Our pizza still cost $23 not including tip. It was enough food for the two of us but by no means a good value or deal. I'm usually one to use coupons but there were none to be found on GrubHub or in my mail.\n\nThe pizza itself wasn't bad. Vinny's does make a pretty textbook east-coast style 'za. Thin, soft crust that you have to fold to eat properly. It was perhaps a little greasy and in my opinion lacking sauce. The amount of sausage seemed a little skimpy, and the sausage they used didn't seem that great. I could hardly taste them because they were so small. In my experience, good sausage adds an entire complex of flavor to a pizza, this didn't really do that and some slices had only a couple pieces on them.\n\nI just thought it was a little underwhelming for an over $23 2-topping, 14'' pizza.

I was very nervous about trying on gowns, because I had never tried on wedding dresses before.  First impressions of Elite Bridal were great! Upon walking into the shop, I was greeted by very friendly consultants.  One of the consultants (Sicelley-not sure about the spelling of her name-oops!), took my group and I to a table to sit down and talk about what kind of look I was going for.  At the time I was planning on doing a destination beach wedding, but was not 100% sure that was what we would end up doing.  She let my group and I walk around and look at all of the dresses and pull the ones that we wanted to try....I tried on A LOT of dresses and all different styles.  While trying on the different dresses, I found multiple that I liked.  The consultant got a good idea of what I was looking for and pulled 3 different dresses that she thought I might like.  (None of which my group or I originally picked).  All 3 that the consultant picked for me were my top 3 favorite dresses! I liked them all a lot and they were perfect for the beach theme destination wedding!  The best part of all, is the dresses were great prices!!!!  Of course they have some more expensive ones, but it just happens that I liked the cheaper ones.  I was pretty much set on a dress from there, but I had an appointment with another bridal shop in town right after, so I figured that I should check them out too.  The girls at Elite were completely understanding that I was not ready to buy a dress yet and they did not make me feel bad or pressure me at all!!  When I went to the other dress shop, I could not find anything that I liked as much as the dresses at Elite. The consultant was very nice, but I felt like my experience at Elite was a lot better.  \n\nSo i decided that this month, I was going to go in and purchase my dress.  I made an appointment and when I got there, they had the dress that I really liked hanging up ready for me to try on.  I tried that dress on again and loved it all over again.  One of my bridesmaids came to this appointment with me that had not come to the original appointment. I told her that if she would like to see me in anything else, that I will try on anything.  So she head out to the racks and brought back a dress that looked completely different from what I had on.  I thought it was pretty on the hanger, but not great.  The consultant (this time was Danielle) helped me into the dress and right then, i knew that was the dress!!  It was PERFECT! I thought I loved the other one, but i REALLY LOVED this one!  I was worried about the cost, because I was already set on the cost of the other dress.  This dress looked like it would be much more expensive, but it was on $100 more!! Danielle let me wear the dress around the shop while I looked at bridesmaid dresses.  It was so comfortable and I felt so comfortable. I purchased the dress and I am so happy with my whole experience!! \n\nMoral of my long story is that Elite Bridal is beautiful on the inside, has many gorgeous gowns to choose from-you may actually have a hard time picking just one! The consultants are very friendly, helpful, and don't make you feel rushed or pressured into buying.  The ordering process was simple.

I don't even know where to get started with this. For readers who don't have the time to listen to all the sad, pathetic details of our terrible experience, let me give you the gist of it here: \n\nMy coffee mug had a lipstick stain. Our server, Chris, refused to change the mug and insisted that he would \"never bring a dirty dish to the table.\" I had to beg another server to please remind Chris to bring us water because we easily waited upwards of 15 minutes for it, all the while, watched him refill about 6 mimosas for other diners. When our flavorless, bland omelette and eggs Benedict (if you can call it that) graced our table, it was brought to us by Chris' manager, since Chris can't really do his job at the most basic level. The \"gravy\" on my Benedict (they don't use Hollandaise for some reason?) wasn't even room temp -- it was cold, as if it was sitting in an ice bath. When Chris strolled on by to ask us how our food was, I said that the gravy was cold and that maybe the kitchen wanted to heat it up for other diners. I didn't want to send my food back because we had already waited 45 minutes for it. I am not even exaggerating when I say that Chris' response was \"Oh, yeah, we have really bad communication in our kitchen. They really just suck.\" and then walked away. \n\nThe CHERRY ON TOP was when he brought us our check ($21.90), my disgusting coffee wasn't comped and my mom had to go to the bathroom. She was gone for less than five minutes and Chris asked me \"where did she go?\" because we weren't paying fast enough for him to flip our table. When she got back, he actually stood over her and watched her count out her cash to pay our bill. We had had already decided the service and food was so laughably bad that we weren't going to tip, so she counted out the 90 cents right in front of him and we went on our way. I called the manager, Adam, about 30 minutes later to let him know how much secondhand embarrassment I had for him due to our experience and he just proceeded to let me know how bad Chris is at his job. Yes, I realize Chris sucks at his job. Why aren't you doing anything about it? \n\nPlease don't eat here. It's straight up not worth it. The food is honestly terrible and literally just fills you up so you aren't hungry. Spend your money elsewhere, trust me."}{"review_id": "NzqRxsoCfzP45QiI4fv1ew", "business_id": "CrIWqmuO2uQWwl3z11K_BA", "user_id": "Oj9ssPsi77teNCwYZ_pBwg", "stars": 5.0, "text": "This place is the best!!!!

Unfortunately advertised special was not exactly accurate, the choices were basically pizza's that were $12 or under unlike the \"Any selection of Traditional Neapolitan Pizza or Italian American Pizza\" advertised on the Visit Champaign site.  Doing my math they did it so the total cost of the three course meal individually would not exceed the advertised \"special\" total 3 course menu price.  Booo!!!!!!  Minus one star.\n\nWe had the pepperoni, eggplant and sausage pizzas.  Quick turn around (good) although the pizza's were all watery. (minus another star)  I've had similar brick oven pizzas from other establishments and none of them have been watery.  Overall pizza was good and not significantly over priced, reasonable size for the price.   Seems to be a great place for a date or a quick meet and greet to chat.  The space was open and laid back.  I'm sure they could fit more tables, but can understand why they are keeping it the way they are.  Probably will not return as plenty of other pizza options and hopefully do not need to start dating again.  I think it fits well into the downtown Champaign vibe, which sadly is the same vibe I got from some of the Chicago area restaurants.

She ordered Fujian rice noodles without the shrimp (they accommodated her due to food allergy). I ordered the spicy braised meat and vegetables over rice--it was delicious. The meat options are beef, chicken, pork, and beef tendon (there may have been more options). I had the beef tendon which are actually kind of meaty, sliced up thinly. The pickled vegetables are paired with sauteed yu choy greens and topped with a boiled egg split in half which was tasty and complemented the overall flavor well. It was not overly spicy. My daughter liked her dish as well. Our server did right by us and we appreciated her helpfulness with the menu items. The sushi rolls were fine--we ordered two 8-pc portions, one spicy tuna, the other salmon. The only minor knock is that its interior has more of a lunch place feel rather than a place where you go to have a nice sit-down meal. I generally prefer warm interior light to fluorescent but if you can get past this and focus on the food, you might enjoy the value of a decent meal at a reasonable price (they gave me a large enough portion of which I took home leftovers).

She created amazing table centerpieces for the reception in the Mansion, even offering to arrange the candles and extra small vases around the central arrangements, as well as decorate the cake with flowers.  In addition, she created very dramatic pieces for the ceremony in the Sunken Garden. All the arrangements contained unusual, eye-catching flowers, some that i had never seen before. My daughter really wanted peonies, which are quite pricey, and Andrea found a local farm source for them to keep costs down and ensure freshness.

Halfar Plumbing did our house after we had a house fire several years ago. They weren't our choice but I think there was a relation between somebody in the company and the general contractor on the job. I can't remember all the things that went wrong with the plumbing after they \"finished\". I know there was a poor solder on a bath tub faucet that leaked when I pressurized it slightly that had to be re-done. I remember they left us with a water hammer inside a kitchen wall that had to be fixed. But what motivated me to finally write this is when one of our toilets just started leaking. The nuts on the bolts were very loose and just a little more tightening fixed the leak. That's maybe not such a big deal. But seeing that made me go around and check all the toilet bolts. One bolt on another toilet just spun around freely, not anchored at all. That toilet hasn't leaked yet but now I have to pull that toilet up and re-do it. I can't believe they just left it like that but I know they did. When I took the plastic bolt cap off (which just lifted off without prying because the proper cap wasn't installed on an extra tall bolt) the bolt was already loose to finger touch. We hardly use that toilet; maybe that's why it hasn't leaked yet. But it's just a matter of time.

Being a vegan, I have only tried the pizza listed as \"vegan\" on the menu, although they will gladly omit meat and/or cheese from any of their pizzas upon request.  On the vegan item, they are very sparing with the thin sauce. The olives and sweety drop peppers come from a jar, and the basil is generous and fresh.  I understand they source the best meats and cheeses and the prices may fluctuate based on the market, but this meatless, cheese-less, jar-based pizza jumped from $10 to $14 overnight.  (Who knows, maybe it was the flour.)  Maybe I seemed surprised at payment, because the friendly cashier then offered a $2/pizza discount and an itemized receipt. Thanks, Fabian!  \n\nThe dough is awesome when it is oven fresh, though it tightens up quickly as it cools.  This can be unpleasant when they forget to bring out all the pizzas at once.  During a dinner, they brought out 2 pizzas, and over the course of 20 minutes I had to ask twice on the status of the third one. From the confusion in the kitchen, it appears our pizza had been forgotten. I got an apology, but no explanation, and no follow up from the staff.  By that time, we had one fresh pizza and two cold, rubbery ones.  I'd cut them some slack at this time, since it was only their 2nd week in business.\n\nBig eaters, don't expect to gorge on a big greasy Amurrican pizza pie for a small wad of cash.  These are dishes made with some skill and dignity, and we could benefit from employing these qualities in our eating practices.  I've eaten an entire pizza at each visit, but it's something to be savored and shared.\n\nI really hope this place succeeds.

He also generously allows you to sample most of the items in the case, which makes this a great place for cheese novices who might want to experiment before they commit to buying a pound of cheese.\n\nTraffic has been generally slow when I've stopped by, so the owner has always afforded me plenty of attention.
